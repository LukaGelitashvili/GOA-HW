    <h2>Bugatti Chiron Super Sport</h2>
    <h3>The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport has a top speed electronically limited to 273 mph (440 km/h). However, this model is engineered for even higher speeds, with a design optimized for extreme high-speed stability. The unrestricted prototype version of the Chiron Super Sport, known as the Chiron Super Sport 300+, reached 304.77 mph (490.48 km/h) during a test run, making it one of the fastest production cars in the world.</h3>
    <h3>The specific model is the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+. This variant was created as an ultra-high-performance model of the Bugatti Chiron lineup, designed to break speed records and provide a unique driving experience at extreme speeds.

       The "300+" in its name refers to its capability of surpassing 300 mph (482 km/h), a milestone it achieved in 2019 during a test run at Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track, where it recorded an official speed of 304.77 mph (490.48 km/h).</h3>
