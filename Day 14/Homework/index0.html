<!-- In HTML and web design, a "page section" refers to a distinct, structured block within a webpage. These sections help organize content, making it easier for users to navigate and for developers to manage the webpage. Common sections include the header, navigation (nav), main content, aside (sidebar), and footer. -->

<!-- #4 -->
<!-- 
In HTML, a header is a semantic element (<header>) that represents introductory content or navigational aids within a webpage or a section of a webpage. It is commonly used to display elements such as: Page Title or Logo: The title of the site or a logo for branding. Navigation Links: Menus or links to navigate between different sections of a site. Introductory Information: Content that introduces the page or the section it belongs to.
The <header> element is versatile and can appear multiple times on a page, such as in the main page header or within individual sections or articles-->

<!-- # 5 -->
<!-- The <nav> tag in HTML is a semantic element introduced in HTML5. It is used to define a section of a webpage that contains navigation links, typically for navigating through a website or within a page. It helps improve the accessibility and structure of a webpage. -->
<!-- Purpose: It organizes navigation links such as menus or tables of contents, making it easier for users and search engines to understand the site structure -->
<!-- Content: The <nav> tag usually contains lists of links (<a> tags) leading to different parts of the website or external resources -->
<!-- Placement: It is typically placed in the header or sidebar of a webpage -->

<!-- #6 -->

<!-- 
The <main> tag in HTML is used to define the main content of a webpage. 
It is a semantic HTML5 element that should contain the central content that 
is unique to the page and directly related to the page's purpose. 
It is meant to exclude repetitive elements like headers, footers, or navigation bars.

Elements you can include inside the <main> tag:
1. <section>: Defines thematic groups of content.
2. <article>: Represents independent, self-contained content like blog posts or news.
3. <div>: A generic container for organizing content.
4. <aside>: Sidebar content relevant to the main content.
5. <h1> to <h6>: Headings to organize the structure of the content.
6. <p>: Paragraphs of text.
7. <img>: Images that support the main content.
8. <table>: Tables for data representation.
9. <form>: Forms for user input related to the main content.
10. Any other content elements specific to the main functionality of the page.

Important Notes:
- The <main> element must not be a child of <article>, <aside>, <header>, <footer>, or <nav>.
- It should appear only once on a webpage for accessibility and clarity.
-->


<!-- <section>:
    The <section> tag defines a thematic grouping of content within a document. It typically represents a standalone part of a page, such as chapters, headers, or other related content.
    Example usage: A website's "About Us" section.
    
    <article>:
    The <article> tag is used for self-contained pieces of content that can stand alone or be distributed independently, such as blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.
    Example usage: Each individual blog post in a list of posts.
    
    <div>:
    The <div> tag is a generic container for grouping and styling content. It doesn't have semantic meaning and is mostly used for layout purposes or as a wrapper for other elements.
    Example usage: Wrapping a section to apply specific CSS or JavaScript.
    
    <footer>:
    The <footer> tag defines the footer for a document or section, often containing copyright information, navigation links, or author details.
    Example usage: The bottom part of a page with contact info and legal disclaimers.
    
    <aside>:
    The <aside> tag is used for content related to the main content but not essential to it, such as sidebars, ads, or related links.
    Example usage: A sidebar with recent articles or advertisements. -->
